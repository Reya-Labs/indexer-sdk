## Branching model

You should branch off `main` when building a feature.
So just go on `main`, pull latest and then branch out of it.
Create your PR against `main`.

Branch naming is quite standard, we tried to duplicate what we have done for
the committing messages, following standard commit message format: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/].

Branch names can start with the prefixes found in the regex under '.husky/pre-commit'.

### Short summary:

**DEVELOPING**
* create a branch from `main`, follow the naming convention for a branch
* wait for approval, resolve comments and make sure you have a green build
* merge to `main` using **Rebase and merge**

### Rules

**Environment branches (main)**
* merges to branch `main` always release a version to `npm`

**Candidate branches:**
* commits on branches that follow the pattern `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `refactor/*` and `test/*`
